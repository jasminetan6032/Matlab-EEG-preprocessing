# Matlab-EEG-preprocessing
## Code for preprocessing
### To Do: 
- [ ] Upload basic treatment script - filtering and ICA (include instructions for how to use eg. create .mat file for participants)
- [ ] Epoching script - something that will take a list of triggers and epoch variable lengths (I think it's just take the next trigger and subtract to get the epoch length)
- [ ] Upload full HEP epoching script
- [ ] Upload CSD script
- [ ] Upload pwelch function
- [ ] Upload connectivity analyses

(Basically all my neuroanalysis tools that are in code so I know what I have and can use. Also planning to make them flexible and easy to apply to any experiment. You want to be able to say, 'I have an automated EEG preprocessing pipeline I can kick into gear any time you like.')
